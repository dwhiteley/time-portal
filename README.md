Code runs on the Arduino platform (Nano), and drives a ILI9341 TFT display on an Adafruit 2.8" Color TFT Touchscreen Breakout board from Adafruit Industries

Original code created by Clive "Max" Maxfield, inspired by the example found in the [Adafruit ILI9341 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9341)

This project uses the following Arduino libraries:
* [Adafruit_ILI9341](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9341)
* [Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
